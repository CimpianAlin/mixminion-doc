\begin{abstract}

We describe a packet-based anonymous remailer protocol which supports
single-use reply blocks and includes link-level encryption to provide
forward anonymity. We include justification for various design decisions
and a detailed description of attacks and defenses. And some other stuff.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Chaum first introduced anonymous remailer designs over 20 years ago
\cite{chaum-mix}. The research community has since introduced many
new designs and proofs, and discovered a variety of new attacks, but
the state of deployed remailers has changed remarkably little since
Cottrell published his Mixmaster software \cite{mixmaster-attacks} eight years
ago. Part of that is due to the liability involved in running a remailer
node on the Internet, and part is due to the complexity of the current
infrastructure --- it is very hard to add new experimental features
to the current software.

The Mixminion project aims to deploy a cleaner updated remailer design
in the same spirit as Mixmaster, with the goals of expanding deployment
and providing a research base for experimental features. Specifically, we:

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce a new primitive called a \emph{single-use reply block}
(SURB), and describe how to build higher-level systems such as nymservers
using these SURBs. Mixmaster provides no support for replies, instead
relying on the older and less secure cypherpunk remailer design
\cite{cypherpunk-remailer}.  By integrating reply capabilities into
Mixminion, we can finally retire the cypherpunk type 1 remailer network.
\item Introduce link-level encryption with ephemeral keys to ensure
forward anonymity for each message.
\item Provide flexible delivery schemes --- rather than just allowing
delivery to mail or usenet, we allow designers to add arbitrary modules to
handle incoming messages. By separating the core mixing architecture from
these higher-level modules, we can limit their influence on the anonymity
properties of the system.
\item Describe a \emph{reputation server} design to give users more
information about the current state and reliability of Mixminion servers.
% \item probably some more
\end{itemize}

Many of our design decisions impacted anonymity in surprising ways. Herein
we document and analyze some of these influences to provide more intuition
to developers and users.

and then hand out keys for them
and replace the pinging servers
and then do pinging themselves
