\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Chaum first introduced anonymous remailer designs over 20 years ago
\cite{chaum-mix}. The research community has since introduced many new
designs and proofs, and discovered a variety of new attacks, but the
state of deployed remailers has changed remarkably little since Cottrell
published his Mixmaster software \cite{mixmaster-attacks} eight years
ago. Part of the difficulty in expanding the deployed remailer base is
due to the liability involved in running a remailer node on the Internet,
and part is due to the complexity of the current infrastructure ---
it is very hard to add new experimental features to the current software.

The Mixminion project aims to deploy a cleaner updated remailer design
in the same spirit as Mixmaster, with the goals of expanding deployment,
documenting our design decisions and how well they stand up to all known
attacks, and providing a research base for experimental features. We
describe our overall design in Section \ref{sec:design}, including two
designs for a new primitive called a \emph{single-use reply block}
(SURB).  Mixmaster provides no support for replies, instead relying
on the older and less secure cypherpunk type I remailer design
\cite{cypherpunk-remailer}. By integrating reply capabilities into
Mixminion, we can finally retire the type I remailer network.

We go on in Section \ref{sec:dir-servers} to describe a design for
Directory Servers to track and distribute remailer availability,
performance, and key information, and then describe in Section
\ref{sec:nymservers} how to build higher-level systems such as nymservers
using SURBs. We introduce link-level encryption with ephemeral keys to
ensure forward anonymity for each message. We also provide flexible
delivery schemes --- rather than just allowing delivery to mail or
usenet, we allow designers to add arbitrary modules to handle incoming
messages. By separating the core mixing architecture from these
higher-level modules, we can limit their influence on the anonymity
properties of the system.

Mixminion aims to be a best-of-breed remailer which uses conversative
design approaches to provide security against most known attacks.
Many of our design decisions impacted anonymity in surprising ways. Herein
we document and analyze some of these influences to provide more intuition
to developers and users.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{MIX-nets}

Chaum introduced the concept of a MIX-net for anonymous communications
\cite{chaum-mix}. A MIX-net consists of a group of servers, called MIXes
(or MIX nodes), each of which is associated with a public key. Each
MIX receives encrypted messages, which are then decrypted, batched,
reordered, stripped of the sender's name and identifying information, and
forwarded on. Chaum also proved security of MIXes against a \emph{passive
adversary} who can eavesdrop on all communications between MIXes but is
unable to observe the reordering inside each MIX.

Current research directions on MIX-nets include ``stop-and-go'' MIX-nets
\cite{kesdogan}, distributed ``flash MIXes'' \cite{flash-mix} and their
weaknesses \cite{desmedt,mitkuro}, and hybrid MIXes \cite{hybrid-mix}.

\subsection{Deployed Remailer Systems}

The first widespread public implementations of MIXes were produced by the
cypherpunks mailing list. These ``Type I'' \emph{anonymous remailers}
were inspired both by the problems surrounding the {\tt anon.penet.fi}
service \cite{helsingius}, and by theoretical work on MIXes. Hughes wrote
the first cypherpunks anonymous remailer \cite{remailer-history}; Finney
followed closely with a collection of scripts which used Phil Zimmermann's
PGP to encrypt and decrypt remailed messages. Later, Cottrell implemented
the Mixmaster system \cite{mixmaster}, or ``Type II'' remailers, which
added message padding, message pools, and other MIX features lacking
in the cypherpunk remailers. At about the same time, Gulcu and Tsudik
introduced the Babel system \cite{babel}, which also created a practical
remailer design (although one that never saw widespread use).

\section{Design Overview}
\label{sec:design}

Mixminion aims to bring together the current best approaches for providing
anonymity in a batching message-based MIX environment. We don't aim
to provide low-latency connection-oriented services like Freedom
\cite{freedom} or Onion Routing \cite{onion-routing} --- while those
designs are more effective for common activities like anonymous web
browsing, it seems they cannot provide the level of strong anonymity of
slower message-based services [Do we, uh, want to cite that?]. Indeed, we
further intentionally restrict the set of options for users: we provide
only one cipher, and we avoid extensions that would help an adversary
divide the anonymity set.

We chose to drop backward-compatibility with Mixmaster and the cypherpunk
remailer systems, in order to provide a simple extensible design. At
the same time, we provide a new feature: a reply block mechanism which
is as secure as forward messages.

Reusable reply blocks are security risks --- by their very nature they
let people send multiple messages to them. These multiple messages can be
used to very quickly trace the recipient's path: if two incoming batches
both include a message to the same reply block, then the next hop must
be in the intersection of both outgoing batches.

%Mixmaster solves the problem by not providing reply functionality,
%and instead falling back on the less secure multiple-use reply blocks
%provided by the type I remailer network.

The rest of this section describes the header structure and the
protocol for building and processing messages. In particular, we
focus on two competing ways of providing secure reply functionality,
and the tradeoffs and design decisions surrounding each approach. In
the first approach, we provide a mechanism for doing replies where a
reply message is indistinguishable from a forward message. Because this
approach introduces some attacks which we cannot adequately address, we
then propose a second approach which allows forward and reply messages
to be distinguished but provides better overall security.


\subsection{Approach one: the `header swap' method}

Making forwards and replies indistinguishable prevents an adversary from
dividing the message anonymity sets into two classes. In particular, if
there are very few replies during a given period relative to the total
number of messages, an adversary controlling some of the MIXes in the
network can more easily trace the path of each reply --- even though
the batches may be large, the number of replies in each batch will be
quite small.

At the same time, protocols like Mixmaster include hashes of the entire
message in each header. Each hop in the path checks the integrity of
the header and payload, and drops the message immediately if it's been
altered. But since the author of the reply block is not the one writing
the payload, these hashes can no longer be used. Indeed, since we choose
to make forward message and replies indistinguishable, we cannot provide
hashes for forward messages either. This choice introduces a new class
of attacks known as \emph{tagging attacks}.

\subsection{Approach two: the `distinguish replies' method}

\subsection{Link-level encryption and what it gets us}

Unlike remailer types I and II that used SMTP as their underlining 
transport mechanism, Mixminion clients and nodes will communicate between 
them using a forward secure encrypted channel based on TLS \cite{TLS}.
TLS allows the establishment of an encrypted tunnel using ephemeral 
Diffie-Hellman keys. In order to make sure that the receiving end is the 
one intended by the creator of the anonymous message, the ephemeral key could be 
signed by the receiving node. As soon as a session key has been established 
the Diffie-Hellman keys are destroyed and messages start being sent through the
tunnel. After each message a standard key update operation is performed to generate 
a new key and the old key material is deleted. The update mechanism does not require 
any asymmetric encryption techniques, which makes the process fast.

The above scheme offers forward secrecy in the sense that even the nodes 
that exchange messages are not in a position to decrypt or even recognize 
messages that might have been intercepted on the links. This makes it impossible 
to comply with decryption notices that might be served in some jurisdiction.
It also makes it necessary for an adversary to corrupt and control nodes in order
to have enough information to trace back a forward anonymous communication by 
requesting nodes to decrypt it. Reply blocks can still be used for this purpose.
Even if an attacker manages to get hold of the session key at a particular point
they would have to observe all subsequent traffic to be able to update their key
appropriately. 

The forward secure encrypted channel does not offer any protection against 
traffic analysis. An adversary is still able to measure how much traffic is 
being transmitted and its recipient.

% this makes purely passive adversaries worse off, but really not that

\subsection{Message types and delivery modules}

This one is decided as well. Just needs to be written up.

One issue: delivery information in header or in payload?
There are tradeoffs to each. Describe both and we'll pick one down the
road. (-Roger)

Aaaaarg, no!  It NEEDS to be in the header, else nobody can receive
reply messages without running a server for local delivery. -Nick.

Make sure to describe capability blocks, and mention that they're
certified.-Nick

\subsection{Exit policies and abuse}

Looks quite straightforward. More generally, this should be a discussion
about capabilities for each mix.

How do clients communicate with a mix to learn its capabilities? Or does
the mix communicate capabilities to the directory server and the client
gets them from there? Or both. Ties in with directory server section
below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Directory Servers}
\label{sec:dir-servers}

Although the current Mixmaster protocol does not specify a means for
clients to learn the locations, keys, capabilities, or performance
records of participating mixes, several schemes have been implemented
\cite{mix-stats} and adopted by some clients.  As an adjunct the
Mixminion protocol, we specify such a system.

We begin by discussing some attacks that system of directory servers
must address, and then propose a secure but inefficient design.

\subsection{Directory-related attacks}
\label{subsec:dir-server-attacks}

A fairly broad category of vulnerabilities stems from differing
knowledge among clients over time, and an adversary's ability to
create or exploit such differences.

In the most simple attack, an adversary who controls a directory
server can provide a different information to clients it wishes to
track.  For example, the compromised server might only list MIXes
controlled by the adversary; or only inform certain clients about a
given MIX. 

Even without control of the a directory server, an adversary can still
exploit differences among client knowledge.  If Eve knows that MIX M
is listed on server D1 but not on D2, she can use this knowledge to
link traffic through M to clients who have queried D2.  Eve can also
distinguish traffic based on any differences between clients who use
directory servers and those who don't; between clients who have
up-to-date listings and those who have old listings; and (if the
directory is partitioned) between clients who have different subsets
of a complete directory.  In fact, even if Eve does not know the exact
difference between Alice's knowledge and Bob's, the presence of such a
difference can aid her traffic analysis. [[CAN WE HAVE A CITE HERE?]]

Even with no differences in client knowledge, an attacker can mount a
more subtle attack by delaying messages in a comprimised MIX.  If
Alice sends a message at noon to a MIX controlled by Mallory, and he
delays the message until directory servers remove some MIX M from
their listings, he can conclude that any messages that are still
addressed to M are likely to have originated from Alice's message.  If
Mallory controls a large set of nodes, and can arrange for a large
number of them to become unlisted, he can mount this attack with a
fair probability of success. [[CAN WE DOCUMENT THIS?]]

\subsection{A Directory Service for Mixminion}
\label{subsec:dir-server-design}

As we describe above, it is not merely a matter of convenience for
clients to retrieve up-to-date MIX information; if some client
software supports a static list of servers while other software is
dynamic, this difference can help an attacker distinguish their
traffic.  Thus, we must specify a directory service as a part of our
standard.

In the most basic design, we provide protocols for MIXes to advertise
themselves to directory servers, and for clients to download
\emph{complete} directories,
  \footnote{We have considered, and rejected for performance reasons, 
            PIR-based \cite{PIR} approaches that would allow clients
            to retrieve a subset of the directory without the
            server learning which subset.} 
either directly or anonymously.  To prevent differences in client
knowledge, servers must synchronize with one another, and must only
update their exported data nightly.

To mitigate the effects of changeover, clients should download new
information regularly, but wait for a given time threshold (say, an
hour) before using any newly-published nodes.  To address delaying
attacks, clients should continue sending dummy traffic to de-listed
nodes. [[IS THIS RIGHT?]]

Directory servers compile availability information by sending traffic
through MIXes in their directories. [[NEED TO SAY MORE.]] Future
designs may include more sophisticated measures of reliability.

We do not currently specify a means to detect and blacklist
misbehaving directory servers.  Because the set of such servers is
smaller and more static than the set of nodes, we have some hope for
out-of-band detection.  Additionally, servers can work together to
ensure correct and complete data by successively signing certificate
bundles, so users can be sure that a given mix certificate has been
seen by a threshold of directory servers.

\section{Nym management and single-use reply blocks}
\label{sec:nymservers}

Current nymservers, such as {\tt nym.alias.net} \cite{nym-alias-net},
maintain a set of \{email address, reply block\} pairs to allow users to
receive mail without revealing their identities. When mail arrives to {\tt
bob@nym.alias.net}, the nymserver attaches the payload to the associated
reply block and sends it off into the mix-net. Because these nymservers
use the type I remailer network, these reply blocks are \emph{persistent}
or \emph{long-lived} nyms --- the mix network does not drop replayed
messages, so the reply blocks can be used again and again. Reply block
management is much simpler in this model because users only need to
replace a reply block when one of the nodes it uses stops working.

The Mixminion design protects against replay attacks by dropping
messages with repeated headers --- so its reply blocks are necessarily
single-use. There are a number of approaches for building nymservers
when reply blocks are single-use.

The approach most similar to currently deployed nymservers involves
keeping a set of reply blocks around and using one for each incoming
message. As long as the owner of the pseudonym keeps the nymserver
well-stocked, no messages will be lost. But it's hard to know at what
rate to supply the nymserver with new nyms; indeed, this approach is
vulnerable to a DoS attack to use up all the available reply blocks and
block further messages from getting delivered.

A more robust design uses an imap-like protocol: messages arrive and queue
at the nymserver, and the user periodically checks the status of his mail
and sends a sufficient batch of reply blocks so the nymserver can deliver
that mail. The above flooding attack still works, but now it's exactly
like flooding a normal imap mailbox, and the usual techniques (e.g.,
allowing the user to delete mails at the server or specify which mails to
download and let the others expire) work fine. The user can send a set
of hashes or other indices to the server after successfully receiving
some messages, to indicate that those messages can now be deleted.

Of course, there are different legal and security implications for the two
designs. In the first case, no mail is stored on the server, but it's also
keeping valid reply blocks on hand. The second case is in some sense more
secure but also creates more liability --- the server has no valid reply
blocks on hand in general, but it has to keep mail for each recipient
until it's retrieved. The owner of the pseudonym could provide a public
key which the nymserver uses to immediately encrypt all incoming messages,
to limit the amount of time the nymserver keeps plaintext messages.

Which point on the spectrum is best depends on the situations and
preferences of the volunteers running the nymservers. Hopefully there
will be enough volunteers that users can choose the set-up that makes
them most comfortable.

\subsection{Directory-based attacks}
\label{subsec:attacks-dirbased}

\begin{description}
\item \emph{Comprimise a directory server.} Identical directory listings
  are served by a large group of servers, and signed by all.
\item \emph{Lie to a directory server.}  Signed capability blocks, and
  the fact that a MIX's signing key is its identity, prevent this
  attack.
\item \emph{Exploit differences in client directory knowledge.}  By
  only updating directory information nightly; by urging client
  software to pull updates as soon as possible after their release;
  and by 
\item \emph{Delay MIX packets until directory information changes.}
  The delay in clients' using new information, along with dummy
  traffic sent to de-listed destinations and expired keys, should
  mitigate this attack. However, a complete solution remains an
  open problem.
\item \emph{Flood the directories with nonfunctional MIX entries.}
  Availability statistics should mitigate this problem.  Nevertheless,
  it remains an area of active research. \cite{mix-acc} \cite{casc-rep}
