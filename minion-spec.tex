\title{Type III (Mixminion) MIX Protocol Specifications}

\section{Message Format}

\subsection{Overview}

Type III (Mixminion) MIX messages are composed of a header section and a
payload.  For technical reasons, each message has a main header and a
secondary header, both of which have identical structure.  Each
header is further composed of up to 16 subheaders, which are
addressed and encrypted to the intermediate nodes (MIXes).  We
begin by explaining how the full message is structured but starting
with the smallest building block.

\subsection{Definitions and cryptographic primitives}

- if B is a byte array, B[i:j] (j bytes) is sub array starting at 
  byte i with length j.
- R(n) (n bytes) Generates n random bytes by any secure method.
- Z(n) (n bytes) Generates n zero bytes.
- Len(M) (2 bytes) is the length of message M (* bytes).
- x|y (Len(x)+Len(y) bytes) denotes x concatenated with y.

- PAD(M,L) (L bytes) pads the message M (Len(M) <= L) to length L
  using zeroes.
- H(M) (20 bytes) is the SHA-1 hash of M (* bytes).
- PK_Encrypt(K,M) (128 bytes) The RSA-encryption of a header M 
  using the public key K.  M is padded using RSA-OAEP, and encoded
  with PCKS1.
- PK_Decrypt(K,M) (up to 86 bytes) Gives the decryption of the
  message M (128 bytes) under the private key corresponding to K.
- Encrypt(K,M) (Len(M) bytes) Rijndael encryption (in Counter mode,
  with 128-bit blocksize) of message M using key K.  (All Rijndael
  operations use 128-bit blocks.)
- Decrypt(K,M,i,j) (j-i bytes) Rijndael counter mode decryption 
  using the key material byte i to j.
- PRNG(K, n) (n bytes) Uses Rijndael in counter mode to produce N
  bytes of pseudo-random numbers.
  PRNG(K, n) = Encrypt(K, Z(n))
- SPRP_ENCRYPT(K1,K2,K3,K4,M) (Len(M) bytes) Uses a super-pseudorandom
  permutation to encrypt M with keys K1-K4.  Specifically, we use LIONESS,
  as described in XXXXCITE, with PRNG(K,n) as our stream generator,
  and the keyed-SHA1 construction specified in the LIONESS paper.

  K1 through K4 are 160 bits long.

  Thus, SPRP_ENCRYPT(K1,K2,K3,K4,M) is computed as follows:
            L := M[0:20]
            R := M[20:len(M)-20]
            R := ENCRYPT( H(K1 | L | K1)[0:16], R)
            L := L xor H(K2 | R | K2)
            R := ENCRYPT( H(K3 | L | K3)[0:16], R)
            L := L xor H(K4 | R | K4) 
            return L | R

  For convenience, we write SPRP_ENC(MS,P,M) to denote:
       LIONESS_ENCRYPT(K1,K2,K3,K4,M)
       where K=HASH(MS | P)
             K1 = K
             K2 = K xor 0x00...01
             K3 = K xor 0x00...02
             K4 = K xor 0x00...03

  [XXXX This violates the constraint in the LION/BEAR paper that
        requires the keys to be 'independant'.  Nonetheless, George
	and Markus Kuhn believe it's safe, since all the keys
        will be used as inputs to hash functions before anybody
        uses them. -NM]

  [XXXX Where we use H(K_n | L | K_n) above, LIONESS specifies 
        L xor K_n.  In our case, however, L and K_n are longer than
        the keysize of PRNG.  Rather than truncate L xor K_n (which
        could violate the all-or-nothing properties of LIONESS),
        we use the same keyed-hash construction for all 4 keys. -NM]

  [XXXX From a security point of view I think that what you do is
        optimal. On the other side it imposes 2 additional Hash
        operations per encryption/decryption. I will think about it a
        bit more -GD]

  [XXXX Don't worry about the H(K|L|K) hash operations; combined, they 
        represent about one 500th of the time that LIONESS takes.
        (About 11% of LIONESS goes to H(K|R|K), and about 87% goes to the 
        stream cipher.) -NM ]

- SPRP_DECRYPT(K1,K2,K3,K4,M) (Len(M) bytes) Inverts SPRP_ENCRYPT.

  We also define SPRP_DEC(K,P,M) as the inverse of SPRP_ENC.
    
RSA encryption and decryption is used with OAEP padding, using the 
mask function MGF1 and hash function SHA1.  The security
parameter P is set to be the hash of the following 84-character ASCII
string (a quotation from Thomas Paine): 

     "He who would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his
      enemy from oppression." 

(Though weaknesses have been found in OAEP's original security proofs,
they seem not to appear when you're using RSA.)

All fields are packed in Internet (MSB first) order.

All RSA encryption uses the public exponent 65535.

\subsection{The subheader structure and address extensions}

A subheader contains all the information that a MIX needs to know
in order to check the integrity of a message and route it through the
Internet. The subheader contains the following fields: 

Subheader fields:

Version Major:   1 byte
Version Minor:   1 byte
Shared Secret:   16 bytes
Digest:          20 bytes
Routing Size:    2 bytes
Routing Type:    2 bytes  [total 43 bytes]
  [XXXX 43? Is this a fencepost error? I count 42. And it says 42
        below.
   -RD]
Routing info:    [Routing Size] bytes

* The Version is present to manage concurrent versions of the
protocol. If a packet is received with a version that is not supported
it should be discarded. Nodes must advertise what versions of the
protocol they support in their status blocks; see below.
(Because having multiple versions makes messages more linkable, it is
important to keep too many from existing at a time.)
* The Shared Secret is the base secret that is used to generate all
other keys for the operations of the node on the packet. It must be
kept secret and discarded as soon as the packet has been processed. 
* The Digest contains an integrity check of the remainder of the
current header (128*15 bytes in total).  It is calculated on the
remaining subheaders and the junk that will be present at then end 
of headers when the node receives the message. 

[XXXX Don't we want the digest to cover the current subheader too?
      Otherwise a bad server can modify the directly-next-header
      (he still can't know what he's changing, but hey). -RD]

* The Routing Type of a message defines how the MIX should deliver or
  relay it.  Most routing methods require addition addressing information.
  The Routing Size field indicates the total size of the routing
  information.   If the information is too long to fit in a single
  subheader, it may spill into subsequent subheaders.

  If a MIX receives a routing type it does not recognize, it must
  discard the message. 

  The subheader is encrypted using RSA after having been padded
  using OAEP, using a 1024 bit key.  This results in an encrypted block
  of 128 bytes.  If the routing info is longer than 86-42=44 bytes, then
  one or more additional subheaders have to be added.

  When an additional block is added to fit the routing info, it must be a
  multiple of 128 bytes and should have the following structure:
 
  Routing Extension:

    Address Data:     Variable
    Padding:          Variable

* The address data length is specified by the ``Routing Size'' field
  contained in the subheader.
* Padding of zeroes is used to make the size of the Routing Extension a
  multiple of 128 bytes.  

  [XXXX Something's wrong here. the routing size limits the routing info
        in the first subheader to fit within the 86 byte limit (the
        size of the plaintext of a subheader), but here we talk about
        128, the size of the crypttext of the subheader. What's up?
   -RD]

The Routing Extension corresponding to a particular subheader is
encrypted using the Encrypt function with key=Hash(Shared Secret,
``ROUTING EXTENSION SECRET KEY'') and appended to the RSA encrypted
subheader.

We will formally refer to the subheader structure as:
SHS(V, SK, D, F, A)
And to the RSA-OAEP encrypted subheader structure as:
ESHS(PK, SK, D, F, A)

[XXXX What are F and A here? Is SHS always 68 bytes, or "up to 68 bytes",
      or 68+68n {n:1,...} bytes, or an arbitrary number of bytes, or what?
      Similarly, ESHS is always 128 bytes? Or 128+128N?
 -RD]

\subsection{Routing information}

There are 5 predefined routing types:

0x0000-0x00FF: PROTOCOL SUPPORT

0x0000 DROP    (0 bytes of routing information)
0x0001 FWD/IP4 (IP: 4 bytes, PORT: 2 bytes, KEYID: 20 bytes): 26 bytes
0x0002 SWAP-FWD/IPV4 (same info as FWD/IP4)

0x0100-0x0FFF: PREDEFINED DELIVERY TYPES.

0x0100 SMTP   (EMAIL ADDRESS: variable, TAG: variable) Variable bytes
0x0101 LOCAL  (USER: variable, TAG: variable) Variable bytes

0x1000-0xEFFF: UNALLOCATED

0xF000-0xFFFF: FOR EXPERIMENTAL USE

A DROP routing type indicates a dummy message, to be discarded.

A FWD/IP4 routing type indicates that the message has to be
retransmitted using the TLS/Mixmaster transport protocol. The IP field
of represents the IPv4 address.  The KEYID field represents the hash of
the next node's tranport public key.

[XXXX Are the TLS keys different from the keys used to encrypt the
      headers?  I claim they should be. -NM]
[XXXX YES! They have to be different since they are discarded after
      the key exchange. The signature/verifucation key pair can be
      used for both purposes (signing ethemeral keys, and signing the
      mix encryption keys).
[XXXX That's not what I meant:  Is a server's RSA key that it uses 
      for decrypting headers, the same RSA key as key it uses for
      MMTP (as hashed in KeyID.)?  I still say yes... -NM]
[XXXX The hashed KEY ID is the verification key that is used to sign
      both the MMTP Ephemeral keys and (if we want) the long term
      decryption keys of the mix. -GD]
[XXXX Actually, it would be easier, and a little less paranoia-engendering,
      if the keys were different.  As I see it, a Mix should have 3
      public keys:
              1  A medium-term connection key that it uses for MMTP.
              2  A medium-term mix key that it uses to decrypt 
                 its subheaders.
              3  A long-term ``identity'' key that signs descriptor
                 blocks containing the first 2.
         Having '3' be different from '1' or '2' is a clear choice; 
         IMO '2' should be different from '1' because:
                a) I may be paranoid, but I don't like the idea of 
                   using the same key for signing stuff and decrypting
                   stuff.  It makes me think of adaptive attacks.
                b) It's easier to implement that way: Keeping non-SSL 
                   RSA keys separaterly from SSL RSA keys makes things
                   more modular.
                c) It costs us nothing in performance, except when
                   we generate new keys.
             -NM]

A SWAP routing type tells the node to exchange headers as described below.

The EMAIL field in the SMTP type of address should be a valid email
address [RFC2821].  It must be NUL-terminated.  The TAG field is
appended to the message in an X-Remailer-Tag header.

The LOCAL routing type is used for messages to be delivered to a local
user.  The USER field must be NUL-terminated; the TAG field is
free-form.

(Tag fields can be used to implement stateless reply blocks by
reminding recipients of the master secrets they used to generate the
reply block.)

[XXXX Where has the RTRN type gone? I guess you can do the same job
with the LOCAL field but I would prefer to have it specified as a
separate type in the standard. 

0x0101 RTRN  (HOPS: 1 byte , KEY: 20 bytes) : 21 bytes -GD]

[XXXX Hm.  I'd rather not have 2 types that do exactly the same thing.
      Perhaps RTRN should behave differently, or LOCAL should have a
      type field of its own.

      As things stand above, you can do stateless return delivery with
      either of SMTP or LOCAL; neither is more "returny" than the other.

      Would it solve your concerns to add a type field to LOCAL? -NM]
[XXXX Ok, here is my real concern: I do not want every differen client
      to implement their own version of the stateless reply block, in
such a way that they cannot interoperate. So I would rather have some 
standard fields containing the HOPS and KEY information along with any
other variable information. -GD]
[XXXX Ok, I agree with your goal of standardizing stateless replies,
      but I think they should go into a section on 'How to do
      stateless replies', so they can be orthogonal to SMTP/LOCAL/Foo  

      Proposed text:
         If a client does not wish to remember all of her outstanding
         reply blocks, she may generate them a 'stateless' mode.  She  
         does so by using an SMTP or LOCAL delivery type, and setting
         the TAG field to 
              (nHops | E(seed, sha1(password) | pad up to 32b.

         She uses PRNG(seed, nHops*16) to form the SK_i's in the reply
         block, and to reconstruct them later when she receives the 
         message.
       
         If the client has complete trust in the final hop, she may
         use a null password.  Beware, however: an attacker who recovers 
         the seed can use it to link any of the hops along the reply 
         chain.

	 To keep replies indistinguishable from encrypted/tagged
         forwards, we set the TAG field of SMTP/Local to =exactly=
         32K.

         Sound ok?                                 -NM ]

\subsection{The header structure}

Each type III message has two identical headers that are swapped at
the crossover point.

A header is 16*128 bytes long and contains up to 16
subheaders. Assuming that we have N subheaders SH0..SHN containing
secrets SK0..SKN, the header is constructed by appending headers
SH0..SHN together and with some random padding to achieve a total size
of 126*16 bytes. Then, each subheader key is used to create a key
Hash(SharedSecret, ``HEADER SECRET KEY'') with which the part of the
header after the subheader (but including its address extension) is
encrypted with using the stream cipher. 

(In practice headers and subheaders are constructed in parallel since
the Digest contained in the subheader is a hash of all the other
encrypted subheaders and the random data they generate as the message
travels through the network. )

PROCEDURE: Create a single header.

Inputs: A_1 .. A_N (addresses of intermediate nodes), 
	PK_1 .. PK_N (Public keys of intermediate nodes),
	SK_1 .. SK_N (Secret keys to be shared with intermediate nodes),
        R Routing type and information of last header (FWD, DROP, SWAP, etc.)
Output: H (The header)

Process: 
  // Calculate the sizes of the subheaders
  for i = 1 .. N
	SIZE_i = Len(ESHS(PK_i, V, SK_i, Z(16), Z(1), A_i))

  // Calculate the Junk that will be appended during processing:
  J_0 = ``'';
  for i = 1 .. N
	J_i = ( J_(i-1) | PRNG(HASH(SK_i, ``RANDOM JUNK'')[0:16], SIZE_i)
	J_i = J_i XOR PRNG(HASH(SK_i, ``HEADER SECRET KEY''),
  		Len(128*16))[128*15 -Len(J_i) +Len(header_i):Len(J-i)];
  end

  // Create the Header
  H_(N+1) = J[0: 128*16 - sum(SIZE_1 .. SIZE_N)];
  for i = N .. 1
	K = HASH(SK_i, ``HEADER SECRET KEY'')[0:16];
	IF i = N (set appropriate routing type and A_i)
	EH = ( extended_headers for routing info, if len(A_i) won't fit.
  	DIGEST = HASH( Encrypt(K, EH | H_(N+1)) | J_i ) )
	H_i = ESHS(PK_i, V, SK_i, DIGEST, F, A_i) | Encrypt(K, EH | H_(N+1))
  end

return H_1;

\subsection{The Payload of messages}

The payload of a Mixminion message has a fixed length of 32 kb
- 2*16*128 bytes = 28kb.   Payloads indicate their size.

  [XXXX Shouldn't size info go into the header, or no place?  Size
     info makes tagged payloads distinguishable from garbage. -NM]
  [XXXX Size info is quite important as well as some type information.
     Maybe in order to minimise the potential for tagging we should
     encrypt the payload using an encryption key specified in the
     reply block. So the reply block would be (SURB, encryption key,
     first hop, deadline). That would make us waste another 128 bytes
     of payload. -GD]
  [Example body encryption: Apply LIONESS on the whole body of the
     message using a predefined key (K = 0x00...00). Encrypt the first
     128 bytes of the payload using an RSA encryption key contained in
     the reply block information. That way the payload looks random
     and only the final receipient can decrypt it (need to include a
     nonce and a digest in the body of the payload as well). BUT we
     have the problem that the key can be changed by the adversary in
     the reply block ... -GD Any comments?]
  [No, I'm afraid I don't know what to do here, or who, exactly is
     transmitting or encrypting what in your proposal.  Keep in mind 
     that generating RSA keys is the single most expensive operation
     in our system.
 
     Wait a minute... are we sure there's a problem at all?  Consider
     what an attacker would see at the last hop =without size info=:
                            REPLY          FORWARD 
          TAGGED MSG     Payload=opaque  Payload=opaque 
          UNTAGGED MSG   Payload=opaque  Payload= Plaintext 

     And =with= size info, so long as it gets LIONESSED with the
     rest of the message...
                            REPLY          FORWARD 
          TAGGED MSG     Payload=opaque  Payload=opaque 
          UNTAGGED MSG   Payload=opaque  Payload=Plaintext with size

     So the problem only seems to arise when you strip the payload
     padding at the server.  But how does the server know not do
     do this with reply payloads anyway?

     I'm just confused here. -NM]

Size:   2 bytes
Data:   (Variable)

We denote a payload as P.

\subsection{Constructing whole messages}

Given two headers and a payload one can construct a whole
message. The first header (main) must always contain a last subheader
with routing type SWAP.  

PROCEDURE: Construct a message.

Input: H1 (header containing keys SK1_1... SK1_N)
       and H2 (header containing keys SK2_1... SK2_N.  Keys are unused
            if we're using a reply block.)
       P (Payload)
Output: M (the message)

Process:
	// Phase 1
	if (H2 is *not* a reply block)
		for i = N .. 0
	            P = SPRP_ENC(SK2_i, "PAYLOAD ENCRYPT", P)
		end
        else
           [ XXXX what do we use for H2 if we're not using a reply
	           block? -NM ]
	   [ XXXX The above processing is only happening if it is NOT
	a reply block. Otherwise it is impossible to know the keys
	SK2_i. For a reply block there is no other processing]
           [ XXXX Ah!  Perhaps, then, there should be a third
	          procedure that breaks down the relationship between
                  ``Construct a message'' here and ``create a single header''
                  above. -NM]
	// Phase 2
	H2 = SPRP_ENC(SHA1(P), ``HIDE HEADER'', H2)

	for i = N .. 1
		H2 = SPRP_ENC(SK1_i, "HEADER ENCRYPT",H2)
		P = SPRP_ENC(SK1_i, "PAYLOAD ENCRYPT",P)
	end

\section{Processing of Messages}

Messages are transfered from node to node using the custom Type III
transport protocol or email.  A node with private key PK receiving
message M = (H1, H2, P) performs the following operations:

PROCEDURE: Process a message M
	SHS(V, SK, D, F, A) = PK_Decrypt(PK,H1[0:128]);
        If there is any problem with the OAEP padding discard the message.
        Check that D = H(H1[128:15*128])
        Let n_extra = number of extended headers
        H1 = H1[128:15*128] | PRNG(HASH(SK, "RANDOM 
                                               JUNK")[0:16])[0:128*n_extra]
	H1 = H1 XOR PRNG(HASH(SK, "HEADER SECRET KEY"), Len(H1))
        Reconstruct A_i from H1[0:128*n_extra]
        H1 = H1[0:n_extra]
	H2 = SPRP_DEC(SK, ``HEADER ENCRYPT'',H2);
	P = SPRP_DEC(SK, ``PAYLOAD ENCRYPT'',P);

	if routing type is is DROP:
                End.
	if routing type is SWAP-FWD:
		H2 = SPRP_DEC(SHA1(P), ``HIDE HEADER'', H2)
		Swap H1 and H2;
        if routing type is SWAP-FWD or FWD:
	   	Put (H1, H2, P) in queue to be sent to A.
        Otherwise:
		Give (A, H(SK,``APPLICATION KEY''), P) to
		Module manager. 

\section{Single Use Reply Block exchange formats}

[It should contain, use-by date, first hop address, 
 SURB block, public key, etc.
 We can also have a short hand notation for SURBS that only
 use part of the header. One only needs to specify the 
 blocks containing the SURB and a key to pad the junk]

\section{Email Transport exchange format}

[Need to specify how we are going to wrap the message
 as an email. This is only intended for SURB use and
 we should think more carefully about providing a 
 general SMTP/IMAP service.
 There is a need to provide enough information to be 
 able to block the service, for the recipient and to
 filter out messages arriving from the mix network.]

\subsection{Replay Avoidance}

The nodes MUST implement a mechanism to make sure that messages cannot
be replayed. To do this a hash of the secret contained in the
subheader is kept for as long as the as public key under which it was
encrypted is in use. The Hash should be computed in the following way:

X = H(SharedSecret, ``REPLAY PREVENTION'')

The value X is not secret, and its secrecy should not be relied upon.
The integrity of the list should be secured and the X values lists may
be made public.

\section{Type III (Mixminion) forward secure protocol}

[cut + paste from other document]

A special channel should be established between mixes that provides
forward secrecy making it impossible to recognize or decrypt any
message that went through it in the past. In order to establish this
channel one of the two mixes initiates the connection but at the end
of the key exchange protocol the channel is bi-directional. The
protocol should be used when the SWAP-FWD/IP4 or FWD/IP4 address type
is specified in a subheader.

The Mixminion protocol uses TLS (the IETF standardization of SSL) with
the ciphersuite "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA" (defined in
tls-ciphersuite-03.txt).  No other ciphersuite is permitted for
MIX-to-MIX communications.

  [XXXX Do we want to use DHE_DSS instead? -NM]

  [XXXX We don't use AES256 because (a) it doesn't seem to be in
        the works for OpenSSL 0.9.7, and (b) all our other AES
        operations use 128-bit blocks and keys. -NM]

X.509 certificates need not be signed; instead, they must only contain
a key matching that used in the KEYID portion of the header's routing
data.  

Messages are sent from client to server; the client must send a
ClientHello packet to renegotiate session key between all
messages. [XXXX why so often? -NM] If the client does not do so, the
server must close the connection.  [XXXX Is this so? -NM]

[XXXX If there is a key updating operation between every message it means
that every message is encrypted under a different key. It also
provides a very small time window for someone breaking down your door
in order to decrypt what you have just transmitted. Is there a problem
with having it so often? -GD]

Protocol outline: (Portions marked with '*' are normative; other
portions are non-normative descriptions of TLS.)

\begin{verbatim}
- A invents a new Diffie Hellman key 
  (of at least 1024 bits modulus)
  and makes a certificate signed by her signing key.
  A then initiates the SSL Handshake protocol with B.
- B invents a DH key and makes a certificate using his signing
  key.
* A checks that the Hash of the signing key is the same as
  the one contained in the routing info of the subheader.
- The SSL handshake protocol proceeds as normal until a session
  key has been established. All communications are then encrypted
  using this session key.

* A sends "PROTOCOL 1.0", NL.  This indicates the highest protocol
  version A supports.
* If B is not willing to use any protocol A supports, B closes the 
  connection.

  B sends "PROTOCOL 1.0", NL.  This indicates B's choice of protocol.

  If A is not willing to support B's choice, A closes the connection.
  
* A sends "SEND", M, H(M,"SEND") (4 + 32k + 20 bytes)
* B sends "RECEIVED", H(M,"RECEIVED") (8 + 20 bytes)

* A sends an SSL handshake renegotiation message.
  (and MUST not reuse the same key for 
   transfering another message)
  This updates the session key and overrides the old ones.
\end{verbatim}

\emph{Note:}

The old keys must be permanently overwritten. Special care should be
taken to permanently erase them from the Hard Disk and memory. 

The standard transport mechanism over which the MixMinion Transfer
Protocol is TCP over IP. The standard listening TCP port should be 
number 48099 (until we register a port with www.iana.org)

[Q Should we request a system (<1023) or user port -GD]
[Q System ports can only be opened by root. we should avoid needing
to be root. -RD]
[Q I imagine it's hard to register a port with iana. Let's wait on
that til everybody takes us seriously. -RD]

All possible checks should be performed during the transfer protocol
and if any fail the connection MUST stop and all state MUST
be deleted. An error MAY be logged. In particular, if the address
hash element in the Master Header is nonzero, the certificate of
the communication partners must be signed using a key that hashes
appropriately.

\section{Remailer Information Exchange format}

[Need to provide signature + encryption keys, expiry dates, root of
list of hashes, Address, services and modules, policies, ...]

[A more coprehensive list of things that the Remailer information
needs to provide:

Status: Serial Number, Superceeds, Timesatmp created, timestamp to
        refresh, urgency (revokation, routine ...)	  
Address and names: IP Address, TCP Port, Name of Owner, e-mail of
                   admin, trust domain(s) 
RSA Long Term Verification Public Key of server: e, n, timestamp,
                   hash(e, n, IP, Port). (next key hash)
RSA Short Term Encryption Public Key: e, n, timestamp, Hash(...)
Network Services: MixMinion Protocols supported.
		  MMTP Protocols supported.
	          SMTP Support flag, address restrictions.
                  LOCAL Support flag, mailbox restrictions.
	          IP addresses it will accept and send to.
Modules: Modules supported, configurations.
Trust Managment: Hash of the State of the world as the mix knows it at
        that point. This can be the hash of a whole tree:

		           H
             / =           |                   = \
	Internal                               External
 /=                  =\                     /=        =\
Logs of           Previous keys          Other Mix    ...
Seen messages     and config +stats       Per Day
|   |    |   |    |   |   |  ...          |   |   |
Day Day ...  Day  ...
1   2        x


Assuming that mixes talk to each ther every day and some know, and
trust, each others verification keys we create a ``headless''
certification infrastructure. Since not all the mixes are going to
revoke their verification keys in the same day it is possible to 
check that the historic information (and stats) across the network has
not been modified. (there is only the need to reveal the hashes from a
node to the head of the tree to check the validity of the information).
