1. Introduction
 
   For a Mix network to provide anonymity to its users, it is vital
   that those users to provide cover traffic to one another by
   behaving as similarly as possible when choosing paths and servers
   for their messages.  Because of this, it is vital that users have a
   means to learn about usable Mixes -- and that this means yield
   identical results for all users.

   Furthermore, because the Type-III Mix protocol relies on regular
   key rotation in order to limit the size of replay caches and
   mitigate the effect of key compromise, it is necessary for servers
   to be able to propagate information about their state to users.

   This document specifies the message formats and protocols used by
   the type-III remailer network to exchange information about
   servers.

1.1. Terminology

     * Server Descriptor - A human-readable text message describing a
       set of keys and capabilities for a single Mix.
      
     * Directory - A human readable text message describing a list of
       Mixes and their keys.

     * Identity Key - A long-term signing RSA key used for
       authenticating server descriptors and directories.

     * Nickname - A human-readable unique identifier for a Mix.  

     This document uses the terms "MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", "MUST
     NOT", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY NOT" as defined in RFC 2119.

2. Type-III Information Exchange format

   To simplify the work required to write a parser for message formats,
   we base server descriptors on the following extensible meta-format.

2.1. Mix Information Exchange format

   Informally, a Mix Information Message is a sequence of
   newline-separated key-value pairs, with a colon between keys and
   values.  These pairs are divided into sections; each section begins
   with a square-bracketed section identifier.  Blank lines are not
   allowed.

   Formally, a Mix Information Message is a sequence of ASCII
   characters, consisting of zero or more Sections.  Each Section
   contains a Header, and one or more Entries.  Each Header consists of
   an left square-bracket ('[', ASCII 91), an Identifier, a right
   square-bracket (']', ASCII 93), and an EOL.  Each Entry consists of
   an Identifier, a colon (':', ASCII 58), a Space, a Value, and an EOL.
   An Identifier is a sequence of one or more printable nonspace
   characters other than colon (ASCII 33-57,59-126 inclusive).  A Space
   is a sequence of one or more space (' ', ASCII 32) or tab ('\t' ASCII
   9) characters.  A Value is a sequence of zero or more printing ASCII
   characters, excluding NL and CR (ASCII 9, 32-126 inclusive), and not
   beginning with a space or a tab.  An EOL is an optional Space,
   followed by either a CR ('\r', ASCII 13), an NL ('\n', ASCII 10), or
   a CR-NL sequence.

   [XXXX Is there any reason to handle non-ASCII here?  I don't want to
    walk down the road of having a dozen competing charsets and
    encodings. -NM]

   Here is a grammar, using C syntax for characters:

      Message ::= Section | Message Section
      Section ::= Header | Section Entry
      Header ::= '[' Identifier ']' EOL
      Entry ::= Identifier ':' Space OptValue EOL

      Identifier ::= IdentifierChar | Identifier IdentifierChar
      IdentifierChar ::= [Any character from ASCII 33 through ASCII 126
         inclusive, excluding ASCII 58.]

      OptValue ::= Value |
      Value ::= NonSpaceValueChar | Value ValueChar
      NonSpaceValueChar ::= [Any character from ASCII 33 through ASCII
         126 inclusive.]
      ValueChar ::= NonSpaceValueChar | ' ' | '\t'

      Space ::= SpaceChar | Space SpaceChar
      SpaceChar ::= ' ' | '\t'
      OptSpace ::= Space |

      EOL ::= OptSpace '\n' | OptSpace '\r' | OptSpace '\r' \n'

   An example follows (indented by a uniform number of spaces):

      [Section1]
      Key1: Value1
      [Empty_Section]
      [Section-Three]
      Key-two: the second value is this value
      Key3:

2.2. Processing unrecognized information

   To enable backward-compatible extensions of the Exchange format, all
   processors of Mix Information Exchange Messages MUST behave as
   follows when encountering unrecognized headers or entries.
   
   When processessing a section with an unrecognized identifier, the
   processor must ignore the section completely.
   
   When processing a section with a recognized identifier, the
   processor must check whether it recognizes the version number of
   that section (usually encoded in an entry with the identifier
   'Version').  If it does not recognize the version number, the
   processor must ignore the section completely.

   When encountering an entry with an unrecognized identifier, the
   processor must ignore the entry.

2.3. Representing data

   All formats use the following conventions to convert encoded values
   to and from their underlying semantic meaning:

     - Trailing whitespace is always ignored; sequences of whitespace
       are collapsed to a single space.

     - All numeric quantities are represented in decimal.

     - All dates are represented in YYYY-MM-DD format.
     
     - All times are represented in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS or YYYY-MM-DD
       HH:MM:SS.mmmm format, relative to UTC.

       [Compatibility note: Mixminion through 0.0.4 generates and
        accepts only US-style YYYY/MM/DD dates.  To transition to
        ISO-style YYYY-MM-DD dates, version 0.0.5 will accept both
        styles and generate only US style.  Version 0.0.6 will accept
        both styles and generate only ISO-style.  Version 0.0.7 will
        accept and generate only ISO style.]

     - All binary data is base-64 encoded, with all linebreaks and space
       removed.

     - All boolean values are encoded as 'yes' or 'no'.

     - All RSA public keys are first encoded to binary with ASN.1, then
       encoded in base-64, with all linebreaks and space removed.

     - 'Address Patterns' are encoded according to the following
       grammar:

            AddressPattern ::= Address OptPortSpec

            Address ::= '*' | IP OptMask
            OptMask ::= '/' IP |
            IP ::= <an IPv4 dotted quad>
            
            OptPortSpec ::= | Port | Port '-' Port
            
       An omitted mask defaults to 255.255.255.255.  '*' is a synonym
       for 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0.  An omitted PortSpec defaults to 48099 for
       'allow' entries and 0-65535 on 'deny' entries.

2.4. Calculating digests and signatures

   Several places in this specification require Messages to be
   self-signed with a given identity key.  The digest of a message is
   computed with the following steps:

      - First, any trailing whitespace on any line is removed, and every
        EOL is converted to a single NL character.

      - Second, the message is converted to a "stub" format: the values
        of any unsigned entries in the message are replaced with the
        empty string.  (Their entry lines now contain an identifier, a
        colon, a single ' ' character, and single a NL character.)

      - Third, a SHA-1 digest is computed over the resulting stub
        message.

   When signing a message, the signature is computed by taking the RSA
   signature of the digest with OAEP/PKCS1 padding and encoding, as
   described in "minion-spec.txt".  RSA signatures are encoded in
   base-64.

3. Server Descriptor format

   This section describes the format of server descriptors, as uploaded
   to and downloaded from directory servers.  A server descriptor is a
   promise, by a mix's administrators, to provide a given set of
   services, keys, and exit policies over a set period of time.
   
   The first section must be a 'Server' section.  This section MUST
   include each of the following entries in any order, exactly once.
   
        'Descriptor-Version':  the string "1.0".

        'Nickname': A human-readable identifier for this server.  It
            MUST be no more than 128 characters.  It MUST contain only
            the characters [A-Za-z0-9_@] and '-'.
   
        'Identity': This Mix node's identity key, represented in ASN.1,
            and encoded in BASE64.  The modulus of this key should be at
            least 2048 bits long and no more than 4096 bits long.  The
            exponent of this key must be 65537.

        'Digest': The digest of this descriptor.  When generating the
            digest, the Digest entry is excluded as unsigned.

        'Signature': The signed digest of this block, signed by the
            Identity key.  When generating the digest, the Signature
            entry is excluded as unsigned.

        'Published': The time when this block was generated.

        'Valid-After': A date. After midnight GMT on this date, this
            server SHOULD support the operations listed in this
            descriptor.

        'Valid-Until': A date. Until midnight GMT on this date, this
            server SHOULD support the operations listed in this
            descriptor.  This date MUST be at least one day after the
            date in Valid-After.

        'Packet-Key': The public key used to encode encode subheaders
            for Type-III packets.

        'Packet-Versions': A comma-separated list of allowable
            major.minor versions for packets this server will process.
            In a production network, only one value should be used for
            this field. [Added in Mixminion 0.0.3]

         

    The 'Server' section MAY contain the following entries, at most
    once each:

        'Contact': An email address that may be used to contact the
            administrator of this server. Must be no more than 256
            characters.

        'Contact-Fingerprint': Fingerprint of the server administrator's
            PGP key. Must be no more than 128 characters.

        'Comments': Human-readable information about this server.  Must
            be <1024 bytes long.  It *must not* be necessary to read this
            information to use the server properly.

        'Software': A string description of the software this server is
            running.  Must be less than 256 characters.  Softare SHOULD
            NOT take any action based on this field, other than to
            display it.  [Added in Mixminion 0.0.3]

        'Secure-Configuration': A boolean value.  If true, the server
            must not be running in an insecure operating mode. [XXXX
            list these modes.  Added in Mixminion 0.0.4]
    
   [Note: before computing the digest, all implementations must
   normalize CR and CR-LF style newlines to a single NL, and remove
   any spaces and tabs that may have been introduced at the ends of
   lines.]
   
   If this server accepts incoming MMTP connections, it MAY have an
   'Incoming/MMTP' section, with the following entries, exactly once
   each:
   
        'Version': The string '1.0'

        'IP': An IPv4 address, in dotted-quad format.

        'Port': A port at which IP accepts incoming MMTP connections.

        'Key-Digest': The KEYID of this server, encoded in BASE64.  This
              is the same as the SHA-1 digest of the ASN.1 encoding of
              the identity key.  (See "minion-spec.txt" for more
              information.)

        'Protocols': A comma-separated list of the versions of MMTP this
              server accepts.
   
   The 'Incoming/MMTP' section MAY contain any number of entries of 
   and any number of entries of the form:

        'Allow': AddressPattern
        'Deny': AddressPattern
   
   If this server supports outgoing MMTP connections, it MAY have a
   'Outgoing/MMTP' section, with one entry each of the form:
   
         'Version': The string '1.0'

         'Protocols': A comma-separated list of versions of MMTP this
              server supports for outgoing connections.
   
   The 'Outgoing/MMTP' section MAY contain any number of entries of the
   form:
   
         'Allow': AddressPattern
         'Deny': AddressPattern
   
   These entries are order-significant; the first one to match wins.
   The default policy is 'Deny: *'.
   
   If this server supports outgoing delivery mechanisms, it MAY have
   corresponding delivery sections.  See 'E2E-spec.txt' for more details
   on specific types, including SMTP and MBOX.
   
   Other services provided by this server SHOULD each have their own section.
   
   Note: A server MAY omit some of its capabilities from its descriptor.
   It is permissible (for example) for a server that supports incoming
   MMTP connections to omit the Incoming/MMTP section.)  A server
   MUST NOT, however, advertise any capabilities it does not support.
   
3.1. Server Identity

   Every server descriptor contains two fields that identify the
   corresponding mix: the Identity public key, and the Nickname.
   Because only the Mix has the private key corresponding to the
   Identity key, the identity key works as a unique identifier for the
   Mix.

   For user convenience, a mix's Nickname also serves as a unique
   identifier.  Every nickname SHOULD correspond to a single identity
   key: directory servers and clients SHOULD reject descriptors that use
   use the same nickname as a previously encountered descriptor but
   change the identity key.

   All nickname matches MUST be case insensitive.

3.2. Descriptor liveness

   When choosing between multiple server descriptors for the same Mix
   valid at the same time, implementations SHOULD choose the most
   recently published descriptor.
   
   The interval of time between a descriptor's 'Valid-After' and
   'Valid-Until' dates is called its 'Lifetime'.

   If some descriptor's lifetime is in the past, that descriptor is said
   to be 'Expired'.  

   If a descriptor's lifetime is all either in the past or contained
   within the lifetimes of more recently published descriptors for the
   same server, that descriptor is said to be 'superceded'.

4. Directory Format
   
   A directory contains a list of Mixminion servers which are believed
   to be operational at a given time.  A directory MUST contain all of
   the following, in order:
      - A 'Directory' section,
      - A 'Signature' section, 
      - A 'Recommended-Software' section, 
      - One or more server decriptors (see section 3 above).

   The 'Directory' section MUST contain the following entries:
     
     - 'Version': The string '1.0'
     
     - 'Published': The time when this directory was generated.
     
     - 'Valid-After' : A date.  This directory SHOULD NOT be used before
       midnight GMT on this date.

     - 'Valid-Until' : A date.  This directory SHOULD NOT be used after
       midnight GMT on this date.  This date SHOULD be exactly one day
       after the date in 'Valid-After'.
        
     - 'Recommended-Servers' : A comma-separated list of server
       nicknames.  Clients SHOULD NOT depend on servers whose nicknames
       are not on this list to be reliable or trustworthy.

   The 'Signature' section MUST contain the following fields:

     - 'DirectoryIdentity' : The Identity key of the directory server
       that generated this directory.  This modulus of this key must be
       between 2048 and 4096 bits long, and the exponent must be 65537.

     - 'DirectoryDigest' : The digest of the entire directory.  The
       value of this entry is unsigned.

     - 'DirectorySignature' : The signature of the directory digest
       with the directory server's identity key.  The value of this
       entry is unsigned.

   The 'Recommended-Software' section MUST contain the following
   entries:
   
     - 'MixminionClient' : A comma-separated list of up-to-date versions
       versions of Mixminion.  If a client is running a version more
       recent than any on the list, it SHOULD issue a warning.  If a
       client is running a version not on the list, and some version on
       the list is more recent than the client's version, the client
       SHOULD issue a warning, and MAY refuse to run.

     - 'MixminionServer' : A comma-separated list of up-to-date versions
        of Mixminion.  Servers should interpret this list as clients
        interpret 'MixminionClient'.

   Entries in 'MixminionClient' and 'MixminionServer' are in decreasing
   order of preference. Because the version numbering scheme will be
   different for each implementation, lines within
   'Recommended-Software' are version specific.  Other implementations
   of Type-III should generate similar entries in
   'Recommended-Software'.

5. Directory Protocols

   Compliant directory servers MUST provide HTTP URLs to download a
   current directory or upload a descriptor for inclusion in a
   directory.

5.1. Retrieving a directory

   A directory server SHOULD provide one or more well-known HTTP URLs at
   which its directory can be downloaded.  Retrieving such a URL MUST
   yield a currently valid directory, or one which will be valid 'very
   soon' [XXXX how soon?].

   The contents of such a URL MAY be compressed with GZIP to save
   bandwidth and speed downloads.

   Directory servers SHOULD also make their identities well-known out of
   band.

5.2. Publishing a server descriptor
   
   A directory server SHOULD provide one or more well-known HTTP URLs
   to publish server descriptors to the directory.  

   To upload a descriptor block, a client performs an HTTP POST request
   to the upload URL, with the server block as the contents of a single
   parameter, 'desc'.

   The server MUST reply to an upload with a message of Content-Type
   test/plain, and contents of the form

        UploadReply ::= StatusLine MessageLine
        StatusLine ::= "Status: " Bit EOL
        Bit ::= '0' | '1'
        MessageLine ::= "Message: " Value EOL

   If the upload is successful and the descriptor will be accepted into
   the directory, the status MUST be 1, and the message MUST be
   'Accepted.'.

   Otherwise, if the upload was successful and the descriptor will not
   be accepted into the directory, the status MUST be 0, and the
   message SHOULD be a description of why the server descriptor was not
   accepted.
   
   Finally, if the upload was successful, but the descriptor will only
   be accepted into the directory when manually approved by the
   administrator, the status MUST be 1, and the message MUST be a
   description of the status of the desctiptor, and MUST NOT be
   'Accepted.'.
   
6. Generating server descriptors

   Servers SHOULD generate at least a [[two weeks]] of keys in advance,
   and SHOULD allow about [[2.5 days]] for newly published keys to
   appear in the directory.  Servers SHOULD continue to accept packets
   encrypted to old keys at least [[20 hours]] after their published
   Value-Until date, and SHOULD NOT accept new keys until their
   published Valid-After date.

   [XXXX These ranges above are all guesses. -NM]

   Servers MAY refrain from publishing their keys entirely.

   When a server's capabilities or configuration changes in such a way
   as to render a previous server descriptor incorrect, it SHOULD
   immediately generate a new server descriptor for each of the existing
   server descriptors it has published, using the same keys as used in
   the existing published descriptors.

   To advertise a planned outage, a server SHOULD publish a server
   descriptor valid over the time of the entire planned outage, with
   all sections except 'Server' absent.

7. Generating directories
   
   Directory servers SHOULD change their directories only at midnight
   GMT.  

   For every mix, the directory SHOULD either include no descriptors
   from that mix; or include all of that mix's published descriptors
   that are not expired or superceded, and that do not become valid
   before a given cutoff time. [[2 weeks]].

   A directory server decides, for every mix whose descriptors
   descriptors it has received, whether that mix is 'Trustworthy' and
   'Reliable'.  A 'trustworthy' mix is one that is believed to protect
   its users anonymity.  A 'reliable' mix is one that delivers packets
   with high probability and reasonable latency.  Directories SHOULD
   include only trustworthy and reliable mixes on their
   'Recommended-Servers' entry.  

8. Downloading directories

   Any client which has not downloaded a directory since before midnight
   GMT, SHOULD download a fresh directory before generating any packets.

A.1. Versioning and Alphas

   Today's alpha code does not publish its version as '1.0'; it uses
   '0.x' instead (currently '0.2' for Descriptor-Version, '0.2' for
   directory Version, and '0.1' for everything else.)  Production
   versions MUST NOT retain backward compatibility with pre-production
   releases.

   When generating Recommended-Software entries for Mixminion, we follow
   the following policies: A development version of Mixminion (pre 1.0)
   will only be declared obsolete when it is either too insecure or too
   buggy to use, when backward compatibility is broken, or when a new
   stable release comes out.  Stable releases will be taken off the list
   only for security or privacy reasons.

A.2. Generating paths

   Given a valid directory, clients MAY generate paths of any length
   when they send messages.  Nonetheless, client implementors SHOULD
   prefer consider the following approach to path selection, and
   SHOULD be aware of anonymity issues if another algorithm is chosen.

   Implementations MAY allow users to specify paths of their own.  If
   they do, implementations SHOULD at least warn users who generate
   paths that would not be generated by the standard algorithm.
   Implementations that allow path selection SHOULD allow partial
   path selection as well.

   Implementations SHOULD at least allow users to specify 'random path
   of length N', and 'random path of random length (E[length]=N)'.

   [This algorithm is implemented in Mixminion 0.0.5]
   
   The inputs to this algorithm are:
      1) The earliest time at which the path must be valid. (T_Start)
      2) The latest time at which the path must be useable. (T_End)
      3) A template consisting of two lists of server specifiers, one
         list for each leg on the path.  A server specifier is either
         a nickname, or the token 'ANY' to indicate a randomly chosen
         server. When generating a SURB, the first list is empty.
         When using a SURB, the second list is empty.
      4) An exit address, unless using a SURB.

   First, the client builds a list of 'current' server descriptors.
   This list contains every server descriptor that meets these
   criteria:

      A) Is in the current directory.
      B) Is valid continuously from T_Start through at least [[24
         hours] from T_End.
      C) Is published more recently than any other server descriptor
         with the same nickname that meets criteria A and B.
         (Remember, all Nickname comparisons are case-insensitive.)
      D) Expires later than any other server descriptor with the same
         nickname that meets criteria A and B and C.

   The client also builds a list of 'preferred' server descriptors
   This list contains every 'current' server descriptor that also
   meets these criteria:

      E) Has its nickname the 'Recommended-servers' list.
 
   Next, the client resolves explicitly specified servers: every
   server specifier with a provided nickname resolves into the
   'current' server descriptor with that nickname.  If there is no
   such server, the client gives an error message.

   Next, the client picks the exit server (if not using a SURB).  If
   the last entry of the second path specifier is ANY, the client
   chooses an element at random from among those 'preferred' server
   descriptors that support delivery to the exit address.

   Finally, the client picks servers for each of the 'ANY' server
   specifiers.  The client picks 'preferred' server descriptors at
   random, with replacement, avoiding any sequence of two consecutive
   server descriptors with the same nickname.
   
X. Open problems
   
   Because of possible partitioning attacks related to accidentally or
   maliciously unsynchronized servers, the presence of multiple directory
   servers presents sever security issues.  Since solving these issues is
   an active research project, we leave them for a later draft.
   
   Issues include:  How do directory servers synchronize?
   What happens when they disagree?  How many servers must a client
   contact before he/she has enough information?  How do we catch
   dishonest directory servers?
   
                                 * * *
  
   Also: statistics information. Also: we should think about avoiding
            catastrophic failure modes if directories _do_ fail or
            change. -NM

   2. Description of mixing algorithm should go in descriptor blocks. -NM
      [XXXX Unless the mixing method requires special packaging of the
            message we could require the servers to specify the amount
            of anonymity that they expect to give to each message. The
            information theoretic one presented by myself and Andrei
            could do the job quite well. -GD]

   1. Statistics Information Exchange format

   2. Specify: verification for directories.
      [not for first cut]
      [Actually, we may need these first two pieces for Mixminion 1.0;
       else we won't be deployable. -NM]
   
   3. Automatic retrieval of Server Information
   [XXXX I think it is important to have a standard way to query a
         server given an IP and a port. -GD]

   [Why? What's wrong with having the server upload its information to a
    directory server? (Not that I disagree, but I want to know the
    application for this.  Clients can't use it without leaking which
    servers they're interested in, and giving servers the opportunity to
    lie to clients.  What's the upside?) -NM]

   [I believe that this will make it more easy to construct Directory
    servers.  For some reason I have the feeling that it will scale
    better if directory servers know about mixes (and can query them
    automatically) rather than the other way around (mixes knowing
    about directory servers). This way one can run independently a
    directory server, without any collaboration from the mix network
    (other than the ability to request info).
   
    Let's not forget that the mixes *sign* their information with a
    long term key, therefore after you establish that you trust a
    signing key to belong to an honest server, the operation of
    querying a directory server for updates is simply a question of
    transport and not of trust. Of course you still trust them to give
    you a information on a complete set of servers, but this can also
    be checked.  It is also true that the a client requesting only the
    information on the servers it is about the use will ruin its
    anonymity. On the other hand if key updates are not frequent, then
    the client can slowly update its database in the background.
   
    Even more possibilities open up if each mix server give on request
    not only their information but also what they think the state of
    other servers, they have contacted in the past, is. This way each
    server you might contact will give you a set of other servers,
    that can be used by clients to construct a complete picture. Which
    ones are to be trusted is of course an orthogonal issue, but once
    it is decided the updated information could flow very
    quickly. (this is in fact a gossip protocol)
   
    These are the reasons why I think it might be a good idea to have
    automatic on request information from servers. -GD]

   [Hm.  You may have a point.  I'm still going to suggest that we do
    not do this yet, for a few reasons.
   
    First, we need a way for servers to publish their descriptors to
    directory servers.  (Otherwise, a directory server couldn't learn
    about new servers for the first time.)  In other words, a push
    mechanism is needed no matter what.  On the other hand, directory
    servers may or may not need a pull mechanism: we do not yet have a
    design that requires this.  Let's not build it till we have a use
    for it.
   
    Second, it's a bit tricky to specify *which* descriptor a server
    should return.  Today's?  Tomorrow's?  All the ones it knows about?
   
    Third, (this is a variant of 'First') because client use of this
    feature is prone to misuse, we should only provide it to clients
    wrapped in some safe mechanism.  That safe mechanism has yet to be
    specified.
   
    Therefore, I'm going to suggest that we call this feature possibly
    desirable... but that we should first design directories or whatever
    other node discovery mechanisms *may* want this feature before we
    decide that to implement the feature itself. -NM]
