1. General
</h2>

<h3>
<a name="whats-mixminion">Mixminion?</a>  
Type III?  What are you talking about?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>
"<strong>Type III</strong>" is the name for an improved anonymous
remailer design.  It was designed to address known flaws in earlier
deployed remailers, and to resist all known anonymity-breaking attacks
as well as possible.
</p>
<p>
"<strong>Mixminion</strong>" is the name for the project that designed
the type III protocol, and is also the name for the reference
implementation of the protocol. (The protocol used to be named
"Mixminion" too, but when the Mixmaster team
<a href="http://archives.seul.org/mixminion/dev/Apr-2002/msg00045.html">
decided</a> to use support "Mixminion" protocol as the basis for
Mixmaster version 4, we changed the name of the protocol to be more
project neutral.)
</p>
</div>

<h3>
What exactly do you mean by 
<a name="whats-anonymous">"anonymous"</a>?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>
When you communicate on the Internet, even when you use encryption,
anybody receiving or intercepting your communication can tell which
addresses are talking to which addresses.  By "anonymous communication
system", we mean a system in which it is difficult for
anybody&mdash;even the people communicating with each other&mdash;to
tell who is talking to whom.
</p>
<p>
How difficult?  Mix-net designs attempt to prevent an adversary from
learning who is talking to whom, even if the adversary:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Can observe all traffic on the entire network at all times.
<li>Controls some fraction of the servers on the network.
<li>Can alter traffic on the network.
<li>Can insert traffic into the network.
</ul>
<p>
Mix-nets also try to provide <strong>unlinkability</strong>: that
is, to prevent an adversary from learning that two messages were sent
by the same person.
</p>
<p>
(This usage isn't universal. Some projects use "anonymous" to describe
any system that doesn't record your name.  This kind of "anonymity" is
easy to achieve, and we won't mention it any further.)
</p>
</div>

<h3>
Back up&mdash;what's a remailer? 
<a name="whats-a-mix-net">A mix-net</a>?
</h3>

<div class="answer">
<p>Back in 1981, David Chaum wrote a 
<a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#chaum-mix">paper</a>
describing an anonymity server called a "mix".  In Chaum's design,
users encrypt messages to a mix's public key, and send those messages
to the mix.  The mix delays and re-orders the messages in order to
prevent an eavesdropper from correlating messages entering and
exiting.  When it's time to deliver a message, the mix decrypts it,
removes any information identifying its sender, and relays it to its
recipient.
</p>
<p>
In order to prevent a single malicious mix from revealing the sender's
identity, senders route each of their messages through a sequence (or
"chain") of mixes.  This way, if even a single mix in the sender's
chain is honest, that mix prevents an attacker from linking the sender
to the recipient.  The complete set of intercommunicating mixes is
called a "mix-net".
</p>
<p>
The term 'remailer' comes with a more application-oriented pedigree.
It originally referred to anonymity servers that accepted messages
via email and delivered them via email, without necessarily
supporting decryption, batching, or chaining.  Later generations of
remailer added these features, and thus have become true mixes.
</p>
<p>
(You might argue that since Type III doesn't use email for its
underlying mix-to-mix communications, it shouldn't really be called a
'remailer' protocol.  On the other hand, since 'mail' is an abstract
concept, you might argue that Type III's store-and-forward design is
close enough to email as to make it a 'remailer'.  Finally, you might
decide that 'remailer' has become the generic term for 'high-latency
anonymity server,' thus making Type III a remailer regardless.)
</p>
</div>

<h3>
In theory, <a name="how-anonymous">how much anonymity</a> 
does Type III give me?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>
That depends on how paranoid you are.  The Type III mix design is
almost certainly secure for most kinds of users, against most
adversaries.  It is in many respects more secure than currently
deployed mix-nets.
</p>
<p>
In <em>my opinion</em>, which could well be wrong, users of Type III
mixes will probably be secure against anybody without the resources of
a major telecom or government.  People who only use the system
occasionally are (I think) probably secure against telecoms and
governments too, but that's harder to quantify.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, you should be aware of a certain class
of <em>long-term intersection attacks</em> that are effective against
all currently known practical mix-net designs: if you send enough
traffic to the same people over a long enough time, and if an
adversary with a little mathematical ability is eavesdropping on you
and your recipients, that adversary can statistically deduce whom
you're communicating with.  (These attacks require a lot of
traffic&mdash;on the order of hundreds of messages.)
Quantifying the severity of these attacks is an area of active
research.
</p>
</div>

<h3>
So how does Type III improve on other 
<a name="how-improve-deployed-mix">deployed</a>
remailer designs?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>
There are currently two widely deployed mix protocols:
the <em>Type I</em> or "Cypherpunks" protocol, and
the <em>Type II</em> or "Mixmaster" protocol.
</p>
<p>Starting in 1992, Eric Hughes, Hal Finney, and others wrote the
 first Type I remailers.  Type I uses email for a transport, and PGP
 for its encryption.  Later implementations of the Type I protocol
 added new features in an attempt to mitigate some of the protocol's
 weaknesses, with limited success.  Lance Cottrell's Type II (1995)
 software fixed most of Type I's insecurities, but dropped
 support for reply blocks. 
</p>
<p>The following table outlines the feature-differences and security
  differences between the three protocols.  Parenthesis indicate
  partial support for a feature; or partial resistance to an
  attack.  (Note: Type I is not formally specified, and exists in
  several versions.  Claims for Type I below refer to the state of the
  art in Type I, such as it is.)

<p>XXX What else?</p>
<h6>Notes</h6>
<dl>
<dt>a.</dt><dd>Some type I implementations support a XXX directive to
    limit the number of times a given message can be replayed.  Using
    this directive is optional, however, and users of this directive
    are distinguishable from non-users.</dd>
<dt>b.</dt><dd>Some type I implementations support message padding in
    an attempt to prevent an attacker from correlating messages based
    on their size.  This feature is of little or no security benefit,
    however, because: [1] The use of message padding and choice of
    padding regime are up to the end user, thus making senders
    distinguishable.  (In fact, multiple padding strategies may make
    padded messages even more linkable than unpadded ones.)  [2] Mixes
    can trivially distinguish added padding from message material
    (!!!).
    </dd>
<dt>c.</dt><dd>As used here, a "Packet" is a single piece of data
    transmitted across the mix-net, and a "Payload" is the portion of
    a packet containing the sender's data.  If a user's message is
    larger than can fit in a single payload, it may be divided over
    multiple payloads.</dd>
<dt>d.</dt><dd>The number of a path that can fit in a Type III header
    depends on the length of the mixes' addresses.  If all of the
    mixes in a path have static IPv4 addresses, the maximum path
    length is 34.  On the other, if all the mixes have 20-character
    hostnames, the maximum path length is 30.

<h3>
And how is Type III different from other 
<a name="how-improve-deployed-other">deployed</a> anonymity systems?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>Unlike 'low-latency' anonymity systems such as Freedom, Onion
  Routing, Anonymizer, Crowds, Web Mixes, and the Java Anon Proxy (???),
  Type III mixes sacrifice latency for higher anonymity.  Low-latency
  systems aim to provide fast enough end-to-end connectivity to
  support interactive web browsing (and sometimes other protocols such
  as SSH).  This property, however, makes it fairly easy for an
  attacker observing or controlling both ends of the communication to
  correlate the timing of data sent along the channel.
</p>
<p>Unlike 'single-hop' anonymity systems like Anonymizer, various
  anonymous web-email forms, and the now-defunct penet.fi, mix-nets
  route messages through a chain of relays.  Using a single-hop system
  depends on a single trusted anonymity provider to keep you
  anonymous.  With a chain of mixes, if any mix in the chain is
  honest, the connection between sender and recipient remains hidden.
</p>
<p>XXX what else?</p>
</div>

<h3>
And how is Type III different from research/theoretical anonymity systems?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>(The systems in this section are listed as "research" or
  "theoretical" because they are better known through the research
  literature than via any widely deployed implementation.)
</p>
<p>G&uuml;lc&uuml; and Tsudik's 
   <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#babel">Babel</a> mix design
   (1996) addresses Type I's size-correlation and PGP issues, while
   adding multiple-use reply blocks.  Unlike Babel, Type III's reply
   blocks are single-use, and are not vulnerable to end-to-end replay
   attacks.  Also, in Babel, non-exit mixes can distinguish forward
   messages from reply messages, whereas in Type III they cannot.
   Babel has a neat feature in which mixes can insert inter-mix
   detours into the reply path.  A limited version of this technique
   is possible in Type III, but cannot extend beyond adding
   single-mix detours.
</p>
<p>[XXX Mention stop-and-go mixes, flash mixes, DC nets, and so on.]

2. Design
</h2>
<div class="answer">
<p>
This section answers questions related to the design of the type III
protocol.
</p>
</div>

<h3>What's a SURB?  Why doesn't Type III have multiple-use reply
blocks?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>All multiple-use reply block designs that we're aware of suffer
  from a common problem:  anybody who gets ahold of a MURB can use it
  to send an arbitrary pattern of traffic to the recipient.  An
  eavesdropper or compromised exit remailer can use this property to
  trace a MURB's recipients.  (Some MURB designs have additional
  vulnerabilities to replay attacks and flooding attacks.)

<h3>Why doesn't Type III have (insert feature here)?</h3>
<div class="answer">
</div>

<h3>Why don't you just use SMTP with TLS for mix-to-mix transfer?</h3>
<div class="answer">
</div>

<h3>Is the design paper still accurate?  What's changed since
  then?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>Changes since the publication of the original design paper are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We no longer perform key rotation on MMTP connections.  MMTP
    connections are typically so short-lived that it doesn't impose
    any significant overhead to close and re-open any connections that
    stay open for a long time.</li>
  <li>The RSA key length has increased from 1024 bits to 2048 bits,
    which led us to change the way we pack subheaders into
    headers.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<p>Features in the specification not described in the original design
  paper are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>End-to-end encoding to make corrupted payloads, reply payloads,
  and encrypted forward payload indistinguishable from one another
  except by their recipients. (XXXX this wasn't in the paper, was
  it?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Features described in the original paper but not yet fully
  specified are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incoming email gateways.</li>
  <li>Automatic opt-out.</li>
  <li>Coordination between multiple directories. (But see 
    <a href="http://mixminion.net/dir-agreement.txt">dir-agreement.txt</a>.) 
  </li>
  <li>Nymservers. (But see
    <a href="http://mixminion.net/nym-spec.txt">nym-spec.txt</a>.)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>
3. Implementation
</h2>

<h3>Where's the code?  Does it work?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>You can always find a link to the latest release of the code at 
   <a href="http://mixminion.net/">http://mixminion.net/</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to access the CVS repository, there's a regularly
  updated sandbox with anonymous pserver access.  To use it, run:
</p>
<ul>
<li>cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.seul.org:/home/minion/cvsroot login</li>
<li>cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.seul.org:/home/minion/cvsroot co src doc</li>
</ul>
<p>So far as we know, the code works fine.  As of 4 September 2003,
  there are 21 servers running, including 11 with exit support.</p>
</div>

<h3>Can I use Mixminion to send anonymous messages today?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>It depends how anonymous you need to be. For casual use, Mixminion
  may meet your needs.</p>
<p>For the moment, however, we <em>do not</em> recommend using Mixminion for
  messages that require real anonymity.  This is for the following
  reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The code is still under development. There may be unknown bugs
  that could compromise your anonymity.  (We do not know of any such
  bugs.)</li>
<li>In order to test the code, many servers are running in
  configurations that could harm your anonymity.  For example, some
  servers are configured to log verbosely.  Others are configured to
  use the "timed-pool" mixing algorithm rather than the more robust
  "timed dynamic-pool" mixing algorithm. While these configurations
  help us debug Mixminion, they also make it easier for an
  eavesdropper or a compromised server to trace your messages.  The
  final Mixminion release will not support these configurations.</li>
<li>Some features that are necessary for high security, robustness,
  anonymity are not yet implemented.  These include:
  <ul>
    <li>Distributed directories.  (The current centralized directory
      is a single point of failuure.)</li>
    <li>Support for servers with dynamic IP addresses.</li>
    <li>Automatic generation of dummy messages</li>
    <li>Built-in network reliability testing ("pinging")</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>There aren't enough people using Type III today.  Even if the
  software works perfectly, you aren't hidden unless you have a large
  number of people to hide among.</li>
</ol>
<p>So in summary, feel free to play with Mixminion and use it for
  casual anonymity, but don't count on it for strong anonymity yet.</p>
</div>

<h3>What do I need in order to run a Mixminion client?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>Right now, the requirements to build and run a Mixminion client are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Unix-like operating system.  Mixminion is known to work on
  Linux, FreeBSD, Macintosh OS X, and Cygwin.  It is <em>believed</em> to run
  on Solaris, OpenBSD, and so on, but has not been thoroughly tested
  on those platforms.  If you find any bugs, please let us know so
  that we can fix them.</li>
  <li>A working version of Python.  Currently, all Python versions
  since 2.0 are supported.  As of 4 September 2003, the stable
  versions of Python are: 2.0.1, 2.1.3, 2.2.3, and 2.3.<p>
  If you're using Solaris, be aware that some versions of Solaris
  come installed with mis-compiled versions of Python that don't have
  networking support.  Don't worry&mdash;compiling your own Python
  installation is dead easy.  Go to 
  <a href="http://python.org">python.org</a> and start from there.  A
  basic Python installation should take 20-30 MB of disk space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A working C compiler and a copy of Make, in order to compile the
  Mixminion C extensions.
  </li>
  <li>Enough disk space.  The installed code takes about 5 MB.</li>
  <li>A working version of OpenSSL 0.9.7 or higher.  If you don't
  have one, the Mixminion build process can download and compile one
  for you.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>What do I need in order to run a Mixminion server?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>To build and run a Mixminion server, your system must meet the
  requirements listed above for building and running a
  client. Additionally, you'll need all of the following to run a
  server:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A fixed IP address.  (Dynamic IP support is scheduled for
  Mixminion 0.0.6.)</li>
  <li>Enough disk space to hold logs and pending messages.  20-30 MB
  should be enough for pending messages for now.  If you're running
  with verbose logs, you'll need about 2MB per day to hold them.
  You'll probably want to rotate the logs regularly.</li>
  <li>Enough bandwidth.  A cable modem or DSL line seems to be
  plenty; a dial-up connection probably isn't.  [Also, if you pay by
  the megabyte, be careful: the code doesn't currently try to do any
  bandwidth throttling or smoothing, and tends to generate large
  traffic spikes.]</li>
  <li>A fairly reliable network connection.  90% uptime is probably
  good enough; 10% uptime probably isn't.</li>
  <li>Possibly, an MTA (such as Sendmail or Postfix).  This is only
  necessary if you're planning to run an exit server.  If you're
  running in middleman mode, you don't need an MTA.</li>
  <li>Permission. If your terms of service allow you to run a
  remailer, you're set.  If not, you probably want to come to an
  arrangement with your service provider's abuse department.  (On the
  other hand, running in middleman mode is a good away to avoid abuse
  complaints.)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>How do I use the code?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>There are instructions in each version of the release
  notes. (That's the file entitled "README" in the Mixminion
  distribution.)  Additionally, versions of Mixminion since 0.0.5
  include a manual page for client functionality.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Do any GUI clients support it yet?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>Not yet.  The only client is the built-in CLI client.</p>
</div>

<h3>How can I add Type III support to my GUI client?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>Right now, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Mixminion as an external program; invoke it as a separate
      process, and parse the output.</li>
  <li>If you're writing in Python, invoke the functions in the module 
      <tt>mixminion.ClientMain</tt> directly.  (Be aware version 0.0.6,
      these functions will change in order to more closely support the
      proposed <a href="http://mixminion.net/api-spec.txt">Client API</a>.)
   </li>
</ul>
<p>The Mixmaster team currently plans for Mixmaster version 4 to
include a C library to support Type III messages.  This code,
however, is not yet written.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why is it written in Python?  Isn't that slow?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>Actually, no.  Mixminion is written in a mixture of Python and C
  for portability, rapid development, and robustness.  For more
  information about Python's advantages, peruse the documentation at
  <a href="http://python.org">python.org</a>.
 </p>
<p>As for speed concerns: If Mixminion were written <em>entirely</em>
  in Python, it would indeed be slow.  Fortunately, the
  application's performance-critical sections are almost entirely
  concentrated in cryptography and I/O, and by using C for these
  operations, we get close to ideal performance.</p>
<p>(For example, RSA decryption is so slow that the other operations
  a server performs when decrypting and processing a Mixminion packet
  take less than 5% of the CPU resources expended per packet.
  Assuming that OpenSSL's (C) implementation of RSA is already close
  to optimal, we would expect no more than a 5% performance
  improvement from rewriting packet processing in C.)
  </p>
<p>This is a general case of the 90/10 rule: programs usually spend
  about 90% of their time in 10% of their code.  Optimizing this code
  is sufficient to optimize the application; further optimization
  gives diminishing returns.  (This is just a rule of thumb, but oddly
  enough, it turns out that 11.3% of the code in Mixminion 0.0.5 is
  written in C.)</p>
</div>

<h3>When will Mixminion run on Windows?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>When version 0.0.6 is released, it will have command-line support
  for Windows 98 and later.  Some of the code is already written, but 
  more testing and infrastructure are needed.</p>
<p>Mixminion 0.0.5 already runs on Windows under Cygwin.  If you're
  not a Unix person, you probably don't want to bother with

<h3>When will it have (insert feature here)?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>The <a href="http://mixminion.net/cvs/src/minion/TODO">TODO</a>
  file in the CVS repository has a tentative schedule for features
  to appear in future releases.</p>
<p>The schedule in the TODO file is tentative&mdash;and so are <em>all
  other statements</em> that anybody makes, ever, about dates and
  features for future releases.  This is a volunteer project, and
  progress depends heavily on how much spare time Nick has from week
  to week.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the historical wait between releases has
  been:</p>
<table border="1" framge="box" rules="all">
<tr><td>From first CVS commit to 0.0.1</td><td>~6.5 months</td></tr>
<tr><td>From 0.0.1 to 0.0.2</td><td>~21 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>From 0.0.2 to 0.0.3</td><td>~1.5 months</td></tr>
<tr><td>From 0.0.3 to 0.0.4</td><td>~3.75 months</td></tr>
<tr><td>From 0.0.4 to 0.0.5</td><td>~2.75 months</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Nick says that he's trying to shoot for a two month release cycle,
  but this may be too ambitious.</p>

<h3>How do I report a bug in the code?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>Preferably, go to the Mixminion bugzilla page at 
  <a href="http://bugs.noreply.org">bugs.noreply.org</a>.</p>
<p>If this isn't feasible, send email to the list at
  mixminion-dev&#64;freehaven.net, or to Nick Mathewson at
  nick&#109;&#64;freehaven.net.</p>
<p>When reporting a bug, please include <strong>all</strong> of
  the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What version of Mixminion you're using.</li>
  <li>What version of Python you're using.</li>
  <li>What operating system you're using.  (Include OS and
      version).</li>
  <li>A transcript of the interaction between you and the
      program.</li>
  <li>A description of how the program's behavior was different from
      what you expected, if the expected behavior isn't completely
      obvious.</li>
  <li>If you get an error message with a stack trace, the complete
    stack trace.</li>
  <li>If you're reporting a bug in the server, a copy of your server's
    configuration, and the last few hundred lines of your server's
    log before the error.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Who else is working on Type III implementations?</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>The Mixmaster team plans to include Type III support in Mixmaster
  version 4.</p>
<p>Others have expressed interest in writing Type III client libraries
  in C, but no announcements have been made and code has yet been
  publicly released.

<h3>
Is there a backdoor in the Mixminion code? Could there be?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<blockquote>
<p>There is no backdoor in the Mixminion code.  The code is publicly
  available, so anybody who reads Python can check for themselves.</p>
<p>I will never willingly add a backdoor in the Mixminion code.
  (Exceptions: Any testing infrastructure that endangers anonymity
  will be labeled as such, and will be removed before the first beta
  release. The code will cause any testing servers running in
  non-anonymous configurations to advertise themselves as such.)</p>
<p>Of course, if I'm legally compelled to add a backdoor, I probably
  won't be allowed to tell you about it.  Continue to review the
  diffs between releases, and don't trust any release that doesn't
  come with source.</p>
<p>Also, you should probably get worried if this question disappears
  from the FAQ. :)</p><p>&mdash;<i>Nick</i></p>
