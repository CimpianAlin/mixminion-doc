<h3>
<a name="whats-mixminion">Mixminion?</a>  
Type III?  What are you talking about?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>
"<strong>Type III</strong>" is the name for an improved anonymous
remailer design.  It was designed to address known flaws in earlier
deployed remailers, and to resist all known anonymity-breaking attacks
as well as possible.
</p>
<p>
"<strong>Mixminion</strong>" is the name for the project that designed
the type III protocol, and is also the name for the reference
implementation of the protocol. (The protocol used to be named
"Mixminion" too, but when the Mixmaster team
<a href="http://archives.seul.org/mixminion/dev/Apr-2002/msg00045.html">
decided</a> to use support "Mixminion" protocol as the basis for
Mixmaster version 4, we changed the name of the protocol to be more
project neutral.)
</p>
</div>

<h3>
What exactly do you mean by 
<a name="whats-anonymous">"anonymous"</a>?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>
When you communicate on the Internet, even when you use encryption,
anybody receiving or intercepting your communication can tell which
addresses are talking to which addresses.  By "anonymous communication
system", we mean a system in which it is very difficult for
anybody&mdash;even the people communicating with each other&mdash;to
tell who is talking to whom.
</p>
<p>
How difficult?  Mix-net designs attempt to prevent an adversary from
learning who is talking to whom, even if the adversary:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Can observe all traffic on the entire network at all times.
<li>Controls some fraction of the servers on the network.
<li>Can alter traffic on the network.
<li>Can insert traffic into the network.
</ul>
<p>
Mix-nets also try to provide <strong>unlinkability</strong>: that
is, to prevent an adversary from learning that two messages were sent
by the same person.
</p>
<p>
(This usage isn't universal. Some projects use "anonymous" to describe
any system that doesn't record your name.  This kind of "anonymity" is
easy to achieve, and we won't mention it any further.)
</p>
</div>

<h3>
Back up&mdash;what's a remailer? 
<a name="whats-a-mix-net">A mix-net</a>?
</h3>

<div class="answer">
<p>Back in 1981, David Chaum wrote a 
<a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#chaum-mix">paper</a>
describing an anonymity server called a "mix".  In Chaum's design,
users encrypt messages to a mix's public key, and send those messages
to the mix.  The mix delays and re-orders the messages in order to
prevent an eavesdropper from correlating messages entering and
exiting.  When it's time to deliver a message, the mix decrypts it,
removes any information identifying its sender, and relays it to its
recipient.
</p>
<p>
In order to prevent a single malicious mix from revealing the sender's
identity, senders route each of their messages through a sequence (or
"chain") of mixes.  This way, if even a single mix in the sender's
chain is honest, that mix prevents an attacker from linking the sender
to the recipient.  The complete set of intercommunicating mixes is
called a "mix-net".
</p>
<p>
The term 'remailer' comes with a more application-oriented pedigree.
It originally referred to anonymity servers that accepted messages
via email and delivered them via email, without necessarily
supporting decryption, batching, or chaining.  Later generations of
remailer added these features, and thus have become true mixes.
</p>
<p>
(You might argue that since Type III doesn't use email for its
underlying mix-to-mix communications, it shouldn't really be called a
'remailer' protocol.  On the other hand, since 'mail' is an abstract
concept, you might argue that Type III's store-and-forward design is
close enough to email as to make it a 'remailer'.  Finally, you might
decide that 'remailer' has become the generic term for 'high-latency
anonymity server,' thus making Type III a remailer regardless.)
</p>
</div>

<h3>
In theory, <a name="how-anonymous">how much anonymity</a> 
does Type III give me?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>
That depends on how paranoid you are.  The Type III mix design is
almost certainly secure for most kinds of users, against most
adversaries.  It is in many respects more secure than currently
deployed mix-nets.
</p>
<p>
In <em>my opinion</em>, which could well be wrong, users of Type III
mixes will probably be secure against anybody without the resources of
a major telecom or government.  People who only use the system
occasionally are (I think) probably secure against telecoms and
governments too, but that's harder to quantify.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, you should be aware of a certain class
of <em>long-term intersection attacks</em> that are effective against
all currently known practical mix-net designs: if you send enough
traffic to the same people over a long enough time, and if an
adversary with a little mathematical ability is eavesdropping on you
and your recipients, that adversary can statistically deduce whom
you're communicating with.  (These attacks require a lot of
traffic&mdash;on the order of hundreds of messages.)
Quantifying the severity of these attacks is an area of active
research.
</p>
</div>

<h3>
So how does Type III improve on other 
<a name="how-improve-deployed-mix">deployed</a>
remailer designs?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>
There are currently two widely deployed mix protocols:
the <em>Type I</em> or "Cypherpunks" protocol, and
the <em>Type II</em> or "Mixmaster" protocol.
</p>
<p>Starting in 1992, Eric Hughes, Hal Finney, and others wrote the
 first Type I remailers.  Type I uses email for a transport, and PGP
 for its encryption.  Later implementations of the Type I protocol
 added new features in an attempt to mitigate some of the protocol's
 weaknesses, with limited success.  Lance Cottrell's Type II (1995)
 software fixed most of Type I's insecurities, but dropped
 support for reply blocks. 
</p>
<p>The following table outlines the feature-differences and security
  differences between the three protocols.  Parenthesis indicate
  partial support for a feature; or partial resistance to an
  attack.  (Note: Type I is not formally specified, and exists in
  several versions.  Claims for Type I below refer to the state of the
  art in Type I, such as it is.)

<p>XXX What else?</p>
<h6>Notes</h6>
<dl>
<dt>a.</dt><dd>Some type I implementations support a XXX directive to
    limit the number of times a given message can be replayed.  Using
    this directive is optional, however, and users of this directive
    are distinguishable from non-users.</dd>
<dt>b.</dt><dd>Some type I implementations support message padding in
    an attempt to prevent an attacker from correlating messages based
    on their size.  This feature is of little or no security benefit,
    however, because: [1] The use of message padding and choice of
    padding regime are up to the end user, thus making senders
    distinguishable.  (In fact, multiple padding strategies may make
    padded messages even more linkable than unpadded ones.)  [2] Mixes
    can trivially distinguish added padding from message material
    (!!!).

<h3>
And how is Type III different from other 
<a name="how-improve-deployed-other">deployed</a> anonymity systems?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>Unlike 'low-latency' anonymity systems such as Freedom, Onion
  Routing, Anonymizer, Crowds, Web Mixes, and the Java Anon Proxy (???),
  Type III mixes sacrifice latency for higher anonymity.  Low-latency
  systems aim to provide fast enough end-to-end connectivity to
  support interactive web browsing (and sometimes other protocols such
  as SSH).  This property, however, makes it fairly easy for an
  attacker observing or controlling both ends of the communication to
  correlate the timing of data sent along the channel.
</p>
<p>Unlike 'single-hop' anonymity systems like Anonymizer, various
  anonymous web-email forms, and the now-defunct penet.fi, mix-nets
  route messages through a chain of relays.  Using a single-hop system
  depends on a single trusted anonymity provider to keep you
  anonymous.  With a chain of mixes, if any mix in the chain is
  honest, the connection between sender and recipient remains hidden.
</p>
<p>XXX what else?</p>
</div>

<h3>
And how is Type III different from research/theoretical anonymity systems?
</h3>
<div class="answer">
<p>(The systems in this section are listed as "research" or
  "theoretical" because they are better known through the research
  literature than via any widely deployed implementation.)
</p>
<p>G&uuml;lc&uuml; and Tsudik's 
   <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#babel">Babel</a> mix design
   (1996) addresses Type I's size-correlation and PGP issues, while
   adding multiple-use reply blocks.  Unlike Babel, Type III's reply
   blocks are single-use, and are not vulnerable to end-to-end replay
   attacks.  Also, in Babel, non-exit mixes can distinguish forward
   messages from reply messages, whereas in Type III they cannot.
   Babel has a neat feature in which mixes can insert inter-mix
   detours into the reply path.  A limited version of this technique
   is possible in Type III, but cannot extend beyond adding
   single-mix detours.
